He first gained popularity in the early 1970s for movies like Zanjeer and Deewaar, and was dubbed India's first "angry young man" for his on-screen roles in Bollywood. Referred to as the "Shahenshah of Bollywood", "Star of the Millennium" or "Big B",[3][4][5][6] he has since appeared in over 190 Indian films in a career spanning almost five decades.[7][8] Bachchan is widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential actors in the history of Indian cinema.[9][10][11][12][13] So total was his dominance on the movie scene in the 1970s and 1980s that the French director Fran√ßois Truffaut called him a "one-man industry."[14][15]</p>

He has won fifteen Filmfare Awards and is the most-nominated performer in any major acting category at Filmfare, with 41 nominations overall. In addition to acting, Bachchan has worked as a playback singer, film producer and television presenter. He has hosted several seasons of the game show, Kaun Banega Crorepati, India's version of the game show franchise, Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?. He also had a stint in politics in the 1980s.</p>
<p>The Government of India honoured him with the Padma Shri in 1984, the Padma Bhushan in 2001 and the Padma Vibhushan in 2015 for his contributions to the arts.[16] The Government of France honoured him with its highest civilian honour, Knight of the Legion of Honour, in 2007 for his exceptional career in the world of cinema and beyond.[17]
